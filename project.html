                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">This exploratory project assesses the effectiveness of a Logic Programming (LP) approach to integrate computing into middle school science education. Researching LP as a strategy to integrate computing into STEM offers an interesting and viable approach for the STEM+C field. While LP is not a new programming approach, it is under-explored in the STEM+C field where the focus is more on visually-based programming such as block-based programming (e.g., Scratch). Through logic programming, students will learn to represent STEM subject-matter knowledge in an explicit and precise manner, while practicing critical thinking and logical reasoning, and developing computer models based on scientific investigation and problem-solving. A key advantage of LP is in its simplicity and generalizability, and this project will provide valuable information about its effectiveness for STEM content area curriculum development.

                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">Participating in online communities has significant benefits to students learning in terms of students’ motivation, persistence, and learning outcomes. However, maintaining and supporting online learning communities is very challenging and requires tremendous work. Automatic support is desirable in this situation. The purpose of this work is to explore the use of deep learning algorithms for automatic text generation in providing emotional and community support for a massive online learning community, Scratch. Particularly, state-of-art deep learning language models GPT-2 and recurrent neural network (RNN) are trained using two million comments from the online learning community. We then conduct both a readability test and human evaluation on the automatic generated results for offering support to the online students. The results show that the GPT-2 language model can provide timely and human-written like replies in a style genuine to the data set and context for offering related support.
                        Social support theory is the leading framework for providing support in online communities. Guided by social support theory, this study explores the ways of providing emotional and community support using deep learning-based language models. 
                        GPT-2 is a transformer-based language model released by Google OpenAI in 2019. Transformer is an attention mechanism-based architecture. It transforms one sequence into another one with the help of Encoder or Decoder without implying any Recurrent Networks.</p>

                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">Collaborating with Bodong Chen , assistant professor in Learning Technologies at the University of Minnesota and Xin Chen, PhD candidate in Engineering Education at Purdue University, we aim to uncover new insights about the learning analytics community by analyzing Twitter archives from the past four Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conferences.
                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">Through descriptive analysis, interaction network analysis, hashtag analysis, and topic modeling of 10,736 tweets by 1,217 unique Twitter users, we found: extended coverage of the community over the years; increasing interactions among its members regard less of peripheral and in-persistent participation; increasingly dense, connected and balanced social networks; and more and more diverse research topics.</p>

                        <h4>Yammer</h4>
                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">Collaborating with Marcela Borge , assistant professor in Learning Sciences at Penn State University, we evaluated a theoretically informed approach to using Social Media (Yammer) as a means to support the development of a community of learners in an introductory human computer interaction course.</p>
                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">Our primary design goals were (1) to use the social media environment to help develop a learning community that lived outside of and yet fed into the classroom environment and (2) to connect classroom to real world experiences in ways that students could explore in personally meaningful ways. We hypothesized that we could create opportunities for collective sense-making and reflection through these connected experiences. Social network, communication analysis, and multivariate analysis were used to examine the form and function of social interactions in Yammer.</p>
                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">Relying on multivariate analysis, social network analysis and qualitative communication analysis, the results suggest that the theoretically informed approach to using Yammer succeeded in encouraging processes associated with a community of learners. The methods used in this paper may contribute to more effective ways of assessing the quality of discourse in socio-technical environments and the findings provide potential models for using social media as new contexts for developing conceptualization and discourse practices.</p>

                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">We crawled data with 70,950 unique posts, 8,820 threads and 5,589 posters from 2009 to 2014. By operationalizing common ingroup identity theory in a computational model, this study proposed an automated mechanism that modeled both user behavior and textual information to organize discussion forum data by topical structure and enable the users to locate useful information effectively. Specifically, our proposed model offers topic tracing and detection to address how many topics are being discussed, what they are and where they are (which topics are covered by each thread). We are currently seeking to update the analytics system to also include the topic structure or relationships between topics in the system. Some visulizations are presented below.

                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">High Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability is a 5-year 2.3 million project funded by National Science Foundation (NSF). It is collaborative among Concord Consortium, University of California Santa Cruz and the National Geogeraphic Society. The goal is to develop online modules for middle school and high school students in Earth and Space Science classes, testing the hypothesis that students who use computational models, analyze real-world data, and engage in building scientific reasoning and argumentation skills are better able to understand Earth science core ideas and how humans impact Earth's systems.

Online learning has received great popularity in K-12 and higher education as instruction increasingly migrates from conventional methods. To support online learners at a large scale, educational researchers have adopted artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics (LA) techniques such as machine learning (ML) to predict their learning outcomes automatically. However, limited attention has been paid to the fairness of prediction with AI in educational settings that could enlarge inequality in education. In this project, we aim to explore methods and strategies to evaluate and mitigate AI bias as well as explain AI decision-making to support students in Algebra Nation, an online math learning platform with more than 500,000 active students every year. Specifically, we have explored different strategies to enhance AI fairness for education in different tasks such as academically at-risk prediction, peer recommender for help-seeking, and conversational AI for socio-emotional support

                        <h4>Yet Another Predictive Model? Fair Predictions of Students’ Learning Outcomes in an Online Math Learning Platform</h4> 
                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression algorithm. Specifically, we developed the fair logistic regression model and compared the fairness-aware model with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). Fairness is evaluated with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the fair logistic regression algorithm could achieve comparable predictive performance while producing notably higher fairness.
                        <h4>Toward building a fair peer recommender to support help-seeking in online learning</h4>
                        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">This study formulated a new method to provide fair and accurate insights toward building a peer recommender to support help-seeking in online learning. Specifically, we developed the fair network embedding (Fair-NE) model and compared it with existing popular models. We trained and evaluated the models with a large dataset consisting of 187,450 discussion post-reply pairs by 10,182 Algebra I online learners from 2015 to 2020. Finally, we examined models with representation fairness, predictive accuracy, and predictive fairness. The results showed that the Fair-NE can achieve superior fairness in genders and races while retaining competitive predictive accuracy.</p>
